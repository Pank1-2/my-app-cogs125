            <h3>üé® Art of Learning Website Redesign</h3>
            <p>
              As the team lead for this nonprofit collaboration, I guided a group of 5 designers to overhaul the Art of Learning‚Äôs outdated website. 
              Through extensive user research, persona creation, and competitive analysis, we identified key pain points in accessibility and engagement.
              I also served as the main liaison between the nonprofit and our team, ensuring stakeholder goals were consistently aligned with our design decisions. 
              The result was a fresh, intuitive layout that enhanced the user experience for both students and educators.

            <h3>üì∑ Snap-A-Tune Mobile App</h3>
            <p>
              Ever wished your environment could choose your music? Snap-A-Tune is an experimental mobile app that curates personalized playlists using photo recognition. 
              I collaborated with a team of 4 to ideate, research, and design this one-of-a-kind experience. From competitive analysis in FigJam to UX flow mapping and high-fidelity designs,
              I ensured the app remained user-friendly, inclusive, and innovative. This project blends my love for music and design into something truly interactive and fun.

            <h3>üåê Miss Vietnam San Diego Website Launch</h3>
            <p>
              In just 10 weeks, I developed and launched a full website for Miss Vietnam San Diego using Vue.js. Working across time zones with a distributed team, 
              I coordinated closely with two designers to create six responsive web pages that showcased the organization's mission, events, and participants. 
              I regularly met with stakeholders to gather feedback and iterate on designs, navigating the challenges of remote collaboration and shifting schedules. 
              This experience taught me the importance of adaptability and clear communication.
