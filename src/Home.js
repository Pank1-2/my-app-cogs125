      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am an undergraduate student from the Bay Area attending UC San Diego and I expect to graduate in June of 2025. I am majoring in Cognitive Science, with a focus in Design and Interaction, and minoring in Computer Science. I am looking towards a career in UI/UX Design to help create more interactive and intuitive designs. I hope to use my skills to contribute to a more inclusive digital world where my work benefits my target audience.</p>
      <p>
      In my free time, I enjoy music 🎧, eating 🍽, watching TV shows 📺, and collecting sneakers 👟! Come join me as I embark on my design journey!
